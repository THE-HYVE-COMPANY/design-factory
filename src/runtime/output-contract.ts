// output-contract.ts — composes the OUTPUT-CONTRACT block that gets
// glued onto a provider's system prompt. Two shapes:
//
//   Tool-driven providers (`fileWrite === "tool"`) — Claude Code,
//     Codex CLI, Opencode, Kimi. The prompt body (already inside
//     GENERATE_CORE_SYSTEM) instructs them to call Write/Edit. Output
//     contract composer is a no-op here.
//
//   Artifact providers (`fileWrite === "artifact"`) — Gemini CLI,
//     Anthropic API, OpenAI API, Gemini API, OpenRouter API, Ollama.
//     The composer emits a block that pins the agent to ending its
//     turn with a single `<artifact identifier="..." type="..."
//     title="...">…</artifact>` block. The runtime parser extracts it
//     and writes via `/fs/write/artifact`.
//
// collapsed the `requiresArtifactWrap` boolean and the
// `DF_ENABLE_ARTIFACT_CONTRACT` feature flag into a single canonical
// capability `fileWrite`. There is no longer a flag — the provider
// declares its channel and the runtime honors it.
//
// This module is pure. It does NOT decide WHICH prompt to use — that
// decision lives in the caller (prompt-invoker.ts / EditorScreen.tsx /
// the pipeline). It only renders the textual contract block
// and exposes the gating predicate.
